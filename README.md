# Cyberinfrastructure for Intelligent Water Supply (CIWS) Data Visualization Challenge

As part of a research project sponsored by the United States National Science Foundation, we are sponsoring a data visualization challenge. This repository provides details about the challenges. Links to the datasets available for the challenge, and instructions for submitting entries.

## The Visualization Challenge

Water use data is provided by our current research in Cyber-Infrastructure for Intelligent Water Supply(CIWS). This challenge will provide students an opportunity to visualize our water use data in potentially novel and innovative ways to provide feedback to water users for various purposes. The visualizations should be tailored to water users and should have a corresponding ease of access. The challenge will receive submissions from students in both Computer Science and Engineering departments.

## Getting Started



## The Datasets

We've posted two major datasets for this visualization challenge. These include a high resolution water use dataset for an individual household and a high resolution water use dataset for 6 buildings in the Living Learning Center on USU's campus.

## Visit the Documentation Pages

We have developed a set of documentation pages that provide background about our research project along with links to supporting literature. You may find ideas for developing innovative and effective visualizations of the datasets at the link below.

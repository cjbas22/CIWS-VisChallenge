# CIWS Project Summary

# Purpose
Continuous data is provided by our current research into Cyber-Infrastructure for Intelligent Water Supply(CIWS). This challenge will allow for students to visualize water use data in potentially novel and innovative ways to provide feedback to water users for various purposes.

# Local Application
## Campus Residential
The first locally applicable use of new water use visualizations is for Utah State University's "Water Wars" program organized within the university dormitories. The program was previously attempted, but there was no effective means of determining a winner due to the low amount of water meters at the time.
## Household Residential
The ongoing household water use study tracks changes in water use behavior through providing feedback. The best visualizations will be utilized in informational reports to be provided to the homeowners.
